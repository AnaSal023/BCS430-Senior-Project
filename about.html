<h1> About Uni-Thrift </h1>

<h3>Our Problem </h3>

<p>In our current predicament, college students are unable to afford school-related commodities. 
An ongoing global pandemic and a war have created a limited supply of resources. This limited supply
 of resources has caused a price hike in goods that has rendered some students unable to afford their
 college supplies. Our organization’s goal is to help alleviate college students' financial burden 
 and allow them to have the opportunity to make some extra cash. Our organization will implement a 
 web-based solution that provides a student-to-student marketplace to exchange college supplies at 
 competitive rates.</p>

<h3>Problem Description</h3>

<p>College students today are within a special bracket of society. Students are constantly trying to 
maintain a balance between working and studying. Because of this balance, students are more likely to
 make astute purchases. Covid-19 and the war in Ukraine have exacerbated students' finances. The global
 market trajectory is an economic slowdown. Due to the market downturn, inflation has been steadily rising.
 With the rising cost of living, students are currently trying to survive on an already tight budget.</p>

<h3>Project Description</h3>
	
<p>College students are an integral part of society. They are our future leaders and innovators. College 
students are at the precipice of adulthood. Each student is trying to maintain a balance between studying 
and working. College students are, unfortunately, the least paid bracket in society. Students have to plan 
their budgets wisely to pay their bills. However, students are facing a growing dilemma concerning Covid-19 
and the war in Ukraine. These traumatic events have shaken the global market. With an ongoing supply chain 
shortage and rising demand, inflation has skyrocketed. With the rising costs of goods, college students are 
financially insecure with their small, fixed income. </p>

<h3> Our Goals </h3>
<p>Our goal for the project is to provide students with a simple and hassle-free website. The user interface 
will have a modern design and a color palette that's easy on the eyes. Once entering the website, students 
will provide their personal information to set up an account. The student account will go through a thorough 
verification process. The organization plans to ensure that all our users are enrolled students. Once that 
process is complete, the information is securely transmitted to the database. The security and integrity of 
our users' data also play a big part in our mission. Once a student has a verified account, they are then able 
to either buy, donate, or sell items off the website. If a student wants to sell their items, they will go 
through a process of filling out a generated application form. This form will ask general questions about the 
commodity they are trying to sell. If a student wants to donate items, they are going to have to go through the 
application form and click on ‘Donate’. When that happens, everything will be whited out except for item name and 
description. Once that student has sold several items, the buyer will receive the option to review their seller. 
In addition, if a college student were going to buy an item, they would be able to navigate through our curated 
list of selling products. Each product will have a picture of the product, a short description, and its current 
condition. To ensure students are making wise choices, the website will have a strict review system that will 
accurately detail who the seller is and what experiences the buyers had with them. Once the student has finished 
shopping, their items will be generated in an itemized shopping cart, which will proceed to a checkout page. 
The checkout page will ask students to make payments through numerous payment options. Students can choose to 
either have their items delivered or meet up with the seller inside the college campus. After checking out, 
students will receive a confirmation email detailing their purchases. Therefore, compared to our competitors, 
our organization will offer a modern website that will be sleek and easy to navigate when purchasing school items 
at a cheap rate while also allowing students to have an extra outlet of cash outside of their current job.</p>
